I am an MSCS student at New York University, working in [Prof. Brenden Lake's lab](https://lake-lab.github.io/).

My research interests lie in the intersection of natural language processing, computational linguistics, and cognitive science.
Specifically, I am interested in 1) interpretation of both human tasks (e.g., language processing) and black-box neural network models, 2) inducing structures from them, and 3) building models that can generalize robustly by combining them with structures and symbolic modules (through, e.g., neuro-symbolic methods). I believe compositionality is the key to both understanding and improving the generalization of models.
