I am a first-year PhD student at [NYU Center for Data Science](https://cds.nyu.edu/), working with [Prof. Brenden Lake](https://lake-lab.github.io/) and [Prof. Tal Linzen](https://caplabnyu.github.io/).

My research interests lie in the intersection of natural language processing, computational linguistics, and cognitive science.
Specifically, I am interested in 1) interpretation of both human tasks (e.g., language processing) and black-box neural network models, 2) inducing structures from them, and 3) building models that can generalize robustly by combining them with structures and symbolic modules (through, e.g., neuro-symbolic methods). I believe compositionality is the key to both understanding and improving the generalization of models. I am also interested in interpretability of Transformers from both theoretical and empirical perspectives, and hope to connect it to linguistic/CogSci phenomena.
